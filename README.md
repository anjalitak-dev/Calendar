# 📅 Interactive Calendar UI

The **Interactive Calendar UI** is a responsive and dynamic calendar interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to easily navigate through different months, view dates, and visually identify the current day — all while maintaining a smooth and intuitive user experience.

This project is a great demonstration of front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, responsive design, and UI/UX enhancement using pure JavaScript and CSS.
