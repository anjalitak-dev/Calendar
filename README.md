# 📅 Interactive Calendar UI

The **Interactive Calendar UI** is a responsive and dynamic calendar interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to seamlessly navigate through months, view date grids, and visually identify the current day — all while providing a clean and intuitive user experience.

This project is a great demonstration of front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, responsive layout design, and interactive UI building using pure JavaScript.
